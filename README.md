# udacity-sql-nanodegree

This repository consists of projects that I had to complete to recieve Udacity's SQL Nanodegree. With this Nanodegree I can

* Execute core SQL commands to select, manipulate, control access, aggregate, and join data and data tables.
* Use subqueries, several window functions, as well as partitions to complete complex business analysis. Students will also be able to know when to use Subqueries vs. JOINS and make appropriate use of each.
* Clean data, optimize SQL queries and write select advanced SQL functions to meet the use case.
* Produce a normalized data schema out of a denormalized, repetitive data schema by following normal form rules.
* Use the SQL DDL to create and alter table structures.
* Learn the SQL DML to insert and update data in tables.
* Optimize the performance of their SQL queries by creating indexes where appropriate.
* Validate that their queries are performing optimally by using the introspection function of their DBMS. 
* Design consistent data schemas by using the different constraints available in their database system.
* Articulate the differences and tradeoffs between relational databases and their non-relational counterparts, and justify which one is best for different scenarios.
